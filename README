## Overview

Our project has a purpose to find the relation between temperature and water/electricity usage. The solution to measure the electricity is by using the SCT-013
and water by using the YF-S201 modules . Then we will get the temperature by using data from the third-party api.
Lastly, We will convert data in to the graph to show the relationship of how temperature effect used of electricity and water usage.
